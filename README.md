# UM_SI671_Data_Mining_FinalProject_Olist_Recommendation_System

E-commerce is going wild around the world. Building a recommender system
would help the company to provide customers more related options for purchasing,
and ultimately, increase the sales income of the company. The main objective of the
project is to predict review scores with an optimal prediction model. In this project,
matrix methods, classical machine learning and a combined model with network
analysis are utilized to predict the customersâ€™ review scores. We found that the
most important features that contribute to the prediction results are mainly focused
on whether orders are delivered on time and the freight value. SVD++ model,
classical Random Forest Regressor, Network combined Random Forest Regressor
are the best models from the three approaches. Among them, the combined model
has the best performance with MAE as low as 0.84, increasing by 18% from the
dummy regressor.

This repository contains the datasets, code scripts, poster, and the final report.
